			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h5>What if I receive an obscure glazed door and it has clear patches on the glass? <span>〉</span></h5>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>This effect is usually caused by a substance "filling in" the glass etching and turning it almost transparent, usually caused by silicone, or oily marks, which may be from the handling process or manufacturing process.</p>
				<p>To remove any residue on the glass, ideally, lie the door down flat with the frosted side up ( frosting is only on one side not both – so please make sure you check this.) it may take several attempts if the doors are installed ie upright, by wiping/rubbing with a cloth. When lying flat – pour a small amount of methylated spirits onto the glass in the affected area – and leave standing for 10 minutes or so. It has to be methylated spirits available from BQ /Wickes etc – not white spirit, or turps or glass cleaner as they wont remove any coating, or glue residue.</p>
				<p>After soaking for 10 mins or so – rub vigorously and wipe off with a clean towel or rag – any dirty or oily rag, or finger prints could cause a similar problem.</p>
				<p>The process may have to be repeated – depending on the kind of residue on the glass.</p>

			<h5 class="">Please explain U Values and what they mean? <span>〉</span></h5>
			<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
				<p>The U Value of a door is used by Architects to design the thermal performance of an overall structure, which in part includes the door. The heat loss from buildings is affected by many attibutes including the wall design, roof design and window and door designs. The main areas are those with the biggest surface areas so the design of walls and roof insulation are the main factors, but door and windows do play a part. Building Regulation Part L requires windows to meet a minimum requirement of 1.8w/m2K and doors are also 1.8w/m2K. However, better performing products might be specified by Architects as part of the overall building design to meet a particular standard, and sometimes windows are specified at 1.6w/m2K.</p>
				<p>The higher the U value of a product, the lower the level of thermal insulation - hence the greater the heat loss. So in essence hign U values mean worse performance. Within our range of doors we do offer some doors at a U value of 1.8, which is very good for a timber door, but as most of our doors are used in refurbishment works, where there is no U value requirement we give typical U values at 3.0. This is a very low level, and all our glazed doors will be better than this in practice as typical U values for glazed doors are in the range 2.0 - 2.5, whereas solid doors are in the region of 2 - 2.2.</p>

			<h5 class="active">How much can I trim off my door? <span>〉</span></h5>
			<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
				<p>It is advised the no more than 6mm be trimmed from any side, top or bottom of the door. Should this occur the Warranty will be rendered invalid. If in any doubt, give us a call and we will be happy to advise.</p>
